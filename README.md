    playbook_executor = PlaybookExecutor(
        playbooks=[playbook_path],
        inventory=C.DEFAULT_INVENTORY_FILE,
        variable_manager=C.VariableManager(),
        loader=C.Loader(),
        options={'verbosity': 0, 'listhosts': False, 'listtasks': False, 'listtags': False},

v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

pod_manifest = {
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "Pod",
    # ... Pod specification details
}

v1.create_namespaced_pod(body=pod_manifest, namespace="default")
